================
For phase I, you have to add logging to Scala actors. You can choose to do this
any way you like but you will use the information for phase II. A typical trace
will consists in simple text information in log les { one log le per actor might
interfere less with the execution. This way, the logs can be processed using any
tools/language.
As part of the phase I, you have to implement the logging facility and to
write (or reuse) a mid-complexity actor program and to trace its execution using
your facility.
